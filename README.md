# ASL-Learning-App

## Research Notebook

The journal is our team's log of what happened. It records each team member's progress for the day: what we did, what problems were encountered and solved, any interesting things we observed. It's also a place to reflect our own process and explore issues such as what's going well, what isn't, and how we can improve.

### Sprint I (01/23-02/08)

### Sprint II (02/08-03/01)

#### Week I (02/08-02/15)

##### User Interface (Matt)
(Matt) - Researched user flow/UI/UX of similar applications to get an idea of what works and what doesn't. I also started on the activity/user flow diagram for the mobile application. No issues/problems encountered. - 02/13

##### Mobile App Flutter (Aakriti)
1. Downloaded and created hello world app on Android Studio. Working on it now for VSC. 02/15

##### Machine Learning Model (Michael + Jari)
1. Followed Notebook on Kaggle on how to make model for Sign Language based on the pictures
 - Created train, validation and test set
 - Trained the model
 - Achieved 99.08% accuracy on the test set
 - Visualized confusion matrix

Next Steps: How can we save and export the model? How can we make it a Lite Model to use it on mobile?
Problems: Tutorials show different formats of the dataset. Need to understand more deeply to adjust code if we run into problems

2. Converted normal model to lite model using the standard converter provided by TensorFlow. Downloaded lite model.
Next: Use firebase to deploy lite model or upload lite model into flutter app before production already?

#### Week II (02/16-02/22)

##### User Interface (Matt)
(Matt) - Finished the activity/user flow diagram. I also started on the UX/UI prototype using Adobe XD, no issues there yet and should be done in the next few days. - 02/18

##### Mobile App Flutter (Aakriti)
