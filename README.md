### Sprint I (01/23-02/08)

#### Week I
##### User Interface (Matt)
1. Today I learned about this, and then I did that on top of doing that other thing. (01/13 @ 4:30PM) ~example~
##### Mobile App Flutter (Aakriti)
##### Machine Learning Model (Michael + Jari)
1. Followed Notebook on Kaggle on how to make model for Sign Language based on the pictures
 - Created train, validation and test set
 - Trained the model
 - Achieved 99.08% accuracy on the test set
 - Visualized confusion matrix

Next Steps: How can we save and export the model? How can we make it a Lite Model to use it on mobile?
Problems: Tutorials show different formats of the dataset. Need to understand more deeply to adjust code if we run into problems
