### Sprint I (01/23-02/08)

#### Week I
##### User Interface (Matt)

(Matt) - Researched user flow/UI/UX of similar applications to get an idea of what works and what doesn't. I also started on the activity/user flow diagram for the mobile application. No issues/problems encountered. - 02/13

##### Mobile App Flutter (Aakriti)
##### Machine Learning Model (Michael + Jari)
1. Followed Notebook on Kaggle on how to make model for Sign Language based on the pictures
 - Created train, validation and test set
 - Trained the model
 - Achieved 99.08% accuracy on the test set
 - Visualized confusion matrix

Next Steps: How can we save and export the model? How can we make it a Lite Model to use it on mobile?
Problems: Tutorials show different formats of the dataset. Need to understand more deeply to adjust code if we run into problems

2. Converted normal model to lite model using the standard converter provided by TensorFlow. Downloaded lite model.
